    <p>The discovery of gravity is attributed to Sir Isaac Newton, who formulated his law of universal gravitation in the late 17th century. This groundbreaking insight explained the force that attracts objects towards each other and laid the foundation for modern astronomy. Newton's law of gravitation allowed astronomers to understand and predict the motions of celestial bodies, from planets orbiting the sun to the moon's relationship with Earth. It also enabled the development of Kepler's laws of planetary motion and provided the tools necessary for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and the broader cosmos. Gravity remains a fundamental concept in astronomy, essential for explaining the structure of galaxies, the formation of stars, and the behavior of objects in the universe, making it one of the cornerstones of the field.</p>
